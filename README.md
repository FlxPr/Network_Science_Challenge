ALREADY Implemented :

-- Number of overlapping words in title
-- temporal distance between the papers
-- number of common authors

TO IMPLEMENT in the future :

-- Shortest path length between 2 nodes
As real-world networks are heavily clustered, if a link was removed between two nodes the shortest path between the two 
should have a value near original value (1) e.g 2, 3 etc. 

-- Node centrality criteria
Test different node centrality criteria
